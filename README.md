‚≠ê Starbit: The Habit Tracker with Rewards
Starbit is a full-stack habit tracker that combines personal growth with gamified motivation. It allows users to build and maintain daily routines, track progress, and earn virtual rewards like stars and badges. The app emphasizes both user engagement and technical depth, with optional social features to foster accountability and encouragement.

Currently this is a work in progress! 

So far I have implemented:
- sign up / log in
- main homepage logic

What I want to add in the future:
- more customizations (changing background color)
- more features (rewards for X amount of habits tracked, length of streak, etc)
- & more!

As I graduate this May, I felt a little lost for what I will do next, as I currently don't have a job lined up. I wanted to make sure that I hold myself accountable for reaching my goal, which is to land a full-time CS job! This app will help me (and hopefully others in the future!) stay on track with my goals while giving myself things to work towards (rewards)!
